## User Story
Nom Burger! is a simple full stack app that allows the user to input the name of a burger they'd like to eat. The name of that burger will appear in a list on the left side of the page with a button allowing the user to optionally devour it. Once the button has been clicked and the burger has been consumed by your imagination and the technology powering this app, it will appear in a new list on the right side of the page. You can see all of the burgers yet-to-be-devoured on the left, with all of the devoured burgers on the right.
